# Insertion Sort Algorithm in JavaScript

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in JavaScript.

## Algorithm Description

The provided JavaScript code implements the Insertion Sort algorithm on an array of integers. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

1. **Array Initialization:**
   - An array of integers is declared and initialized with predefined values.

2. **Insertion Sort:**
   - The code iterates over the array, and for each element, it finds its correct position in the sorted subarray to the left.
   - Elements greater than the current element are shifted to the right to make space for the current element.
   - The current element is then inserted into its correct position in the sorted subarray.

3. **Sorting Function (Optional):**
   - There's a placeholder for an optional sorting function called `insertion_sort`. You can implement the insertion sort algorithm here if needed.

4. **Print Sorted Array:**
   - The sorted array is printed to the console, providing the result of the insertion sort process.
